# Serverless Framework vs. Terraform: IaC Comparison

This repository compares Serverless Framework and Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Comparison Table:

| Feature | Serverless Framework | Terraform |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary Use Case** | Serverless application deployment (FaaS) | General-purpose infrastructure provisioning |
| **Best For** | Event-driven applications, APIs, microservices | Complex infrastructure, multi-cloud deployments |
| **Primary Objective** | Simplify serverless deployments, developer productivity | Infrastructure consistency, repeatability, version control |
| **Learning Curve** | Easier for serverless developers | Steeper, requires HCL knowledge |
| **Ease of Use** | Simple CLI and configuration (YAML/JSON) | More complex, but powerful |
| **State Tracking** | Cloud provider-specific (e.g., CloudFormation) | Dedicated state file |
| **Deployment Changes** | Incremental updates to cloud provider resources | Plan and apply changes using state file |
| **Infrastructure Scope** | Serverless functions and related resources | Any infrastructure resource (VMs, networks, databases, etc.) |
| **Recommended Scenarios** | Rapid serverless development, FaaS focus, limited infrastructure expertise | Complex infrastructure, multi-cloud, fine-grained control, strong DevOps practices |
| **Combined Use Benefits** | Yes, for managing serverless applications within a larger infrastructure context. Use Terraform for base infrastructure and Serverless Framework for application layer. | N/A |
